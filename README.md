# Machine translation
authors: Karolina Kiejnich-Kruk, Jędrzej Wydra

## What is this project?
This project was conceived by a judge and first author who identified a pressing issue in the legal system: the need to translate legal documents for participants who may not speak the language of the proceedings. While certified translators traditionally handle this task, their heavy workloads can delay the process, potentially limiting access to the right to translation. To address this challenge, the project explores the use of automatic solutions.

Language models (LLMs) now offer phenomenal translation quality, but their reliance on external providers often requires sending sensitive data outside secure environments—a practice that raises significant concerns about data privacy compliance.

## Our solution:
This project proposes a novel approach, leveraging state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in a way that preserves the confidentiality of sensitive legal data. By adapting popular LLMs with some privacy-preserving techniques, the system ensures accurate translations while maintaining strict compliance with data protection regulations.

This innovation not only enhances the accessibility of legal translations but also demonstrates the potential of AI in overcoming practical challenges in the legal field, without compromising the privacy and rights of those involved.
